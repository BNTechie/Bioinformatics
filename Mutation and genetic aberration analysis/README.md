Here's a brief explanation of each of these tools and databases:

### 1. VarScan2
**VarScan2** is a tool for variant detection in next-generation sequencing data. It is used for identifying single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in DNA sequencing data. VarScan2 can perform somatic mutation calling, germline variant calling, and copy number variation detection.

**Key Features**:
- Supports both somatic (tumor vs. normal) and germline (single sample) variant calling.
- Provides detailed annotations for variants, including allele frequencies and coverage.
- Can call copy number variations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH).

### 2. CNVkit
**CNVkit** is a Python-based toolkit for detecting copy number variations (CNVs) in targeted DNA sequencing data. It uses read depth information from targeted sequencing data to infer copy number changes across the genome.

**Key Features**:
- Designed for use with targeted capture sequencing data, such as exome or custom gene panels.
- Produces normalized copy number profiles for individual samples.
- Provides visualization tools for exploring CNV data, including genome-wide plots and detailed segment plots.
- Can be integrated with other variant calling pipelines to provide a comprehensive view of genomic alterations.

### 3. ClinVar
**ClinVar** is a freely accessible public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence. It is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

**Key Features**:
- Contains information about the clinical significance of variants, including pathogenicity, likely pathogenicity, benign, likely benign, and uncertain significance.
- Provides detailed annotations for each variant, including clinical conditions, supporting evidence, and references.
- Integrates with other NCBI resources, such as dbSNP and RefSeq, to provide comprehensive variant information.
- Used by clinicians, researchers, and genetic testing laboratories to interpret the clinical relevance of genetic variants.

### 4. COSMIC
**COSMIC** (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) is a comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer. It is curated by the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

**Key Features**:
- Contains a vast collection of somatic mutations found in human cancer, including SNVs, indels, copy number variations, and gene fusions.
- Provides detailed annotations for each mutation, including frequency, affected genes, and associated cancer types.
- Includes tools for exploring and visualizing mutation data, such as the Mutation Mapper and Cancer Browser.
- Used by cancer researchers and clinicians to study the genetic basis of cancer and to identify potential therapeutic targets.

### Summary
- **VarScan2**: Tool for identifying SNVs, indels, and CNVs in sequencing data.
- **CNVkit**: Toolkit for detecting CNVs in targeted DNA sequencing data.
- **ClinVar**: Database of clinically significant genetic variants and their relationships to human health.
- **COSMIC**: Comprehensive database of somatic mutations in cancer, providing detailed annotations and visualization tools.
